1.  Given this array:  10 18 4 24 33 40 8 3 12

A.  What will it be after Selection Sort after the second pass:

B.  Insertion Sort after the fourth iteration of the outer loop:

C.  Shell sort after the initial phase of the algorithm, if you assume that it uses an increment of 3? (The method presented in lecture would start with an increment of 7, but you should assume that it uses an increment of 3 instead.):

D.  Bubble sort after the third pass:

E.  QuickSort in lecture's initial partitioning phase:

F.  Radix sort after the initial pass:
10 40 | 12 | 33 3 | 4 24 | 18 8

G.  After the fourth call to the merge method of MergeSort as presented in lecture:
3 4 8 10 12 18 24 33 40
