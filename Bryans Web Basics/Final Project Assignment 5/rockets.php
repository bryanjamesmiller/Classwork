                        <li class="news_title">The Acquisition of Dwight Howard</li>
                        <li class="news_story">The Rockets made it big last summer when they obtained free agent Dwight Howard, by far the most sought-after free agent.  Dwight was persuaded to come to Houston by Coach Kevin McHale, a former NBA center superstar himself, as well as another Rockets ex-star center, Hakeem Olajuwon.  Others helped with the appeal as well, including celebrity Jim Parsons, who stars as Sheldon on the TV series "The Big Bang Theory."  Dwight appreciated the fact that Houston had a competitive team and could still pay a big contract.</li>

                        <li class="news_title">A New Twin Towers in Texas</li>
                        <li class="news_story">Before Dwight Howard arrived in Houston, the Rockets already had an above-average center named Omer Asik.  Asik was a big part of the Rockets success in the past and felt upset that he was apparently going to be benched because of the superstar Howard coming to Houston.  In fact, Asik asked to be traded and Houston even tried; however, it was harder to trade Asik than many expected.  Ultimately, the Rockets took a page out of the Spurs' playbook who have started two centers ever since the days of Hakeem Olajuwon, who had to deal with David Robinson and Tim Duncan.  Ever since, the Spurs have almost always started two centers (though Tim Duncan has always played power forward).  In any case, putting both Dwight Howard and Omer Asik in the game at the same time (and even starting both players) seemed to help ease the situation over.  Although Asik did not always get the chance to start, Asik showed his high level of play when given the opportunity to get some minutes and probably remains a great option for many teams in need of an upgrade at center.</li>

                        <li class="news_title">Jeremy Lin and Patrick Beverley</li>
                        <li class="news_story">Two years ago, Jeremy Lin coming to Houston made almost as big headlines as Dwight Howard's arrival.  Quietly, however, Lin has been designated to the bench and Patrick Beverley has become the starting guard in his place.  Many had hoped Lin would continue his superstar ways he had demonstrated in New York.  Of course, allowing Lin to come off the bench probably is a part of the strategy of the Rockets since many successful teams have a 6th man who could star on another team.  In fact, hard to believe as it is, just a few years ago James Harden (Houston Rocket's All-Star guard) played this role for the Oklahoma City Thunder.  It was also a given that Lin would have trouble succeeding with James Harden, since both players require orchestrating the game as part of their ability to succeed.  Thus a 6th-man role made sense for Lin, a humble player, and the scrappy, tough, defensive-minded Patrick Beverley became part of the starting lineup.</li>
