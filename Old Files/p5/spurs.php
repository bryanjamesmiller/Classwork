                        <li class="news_title">Best Record in the NBA</li>
                        <li class="news_story">The Spurs achieved the best record in the NBA for the 2013-2014 regular season, with an outstanding 62 wins and only 20 losses.  The result is the Spurs will enjoy home-court advantage throughout the entire playoffs.  Last year, the lack of home-court advantage in the playoffs may well have cost them winning the NBA championship as they came up just short against the Miami Heat, who obtained the better record a year ago.</li>

                        <li class="news_title">Trip to Mexico City</li>
                        <li class="news_story">The Spurs traveled to Mexico City on December 4, 2013 to take on the Minnesota Timberwolves.  However, a generator malfunctioned and caused smoke in the arena during warm-ups, causing the game to be cancelled.  The game was rescheduled and played in Minnesota later in the season.  The NBA has tried in various ways to market itself internationally, and this trip to Mexico City was one such move.</li>

                            <li class="news_story">During All-Star weekend, Spur newcomer Marco Belinelli won the 3-Point contest.  Belinelli is the third Spur to participate in the 3-point contest in recent years, as both Manu Ginobli and Matt Bonner have also taken part.  All three currently play for the Spurs, perhaps explaining their remarkable 62-win season this year.</li>
